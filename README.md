## Conventions

### Branches

Branches should be categorized (_feature_, _bug_, _research_) and end with the issue number.

e.g. `feature/12`, `bug/3`

### Pull Requests

The person who creates a branch should open a _PR_ for it. A different person should review the changes and either 
comment on why it cannot be merged, or merge the _PR_. For merging the _PR_ select `Sqash and merge` and delete the 
remaining branch afterward.
